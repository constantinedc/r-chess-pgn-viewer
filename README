Chrome users:
Nothing to see here citizen, move along.

Firefox users:
* Viewer broken =(
Grab the latest version (1.92) of the viewer from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rchess-pgn-viewer/versions/). It just went up last Sunday, so it hasn't been reviewed by Mozilla yet. I've tested it with some users and it seems to do the job. 

* Viewer not broken =)
You don't have to update - the changes are purely bug fixes except for two things - clicking on the king three times now gives you the combined chess ability of Kasparov, Fischer & Alekhine*, and the queen now whispers sweet nothings in your ear while you play (or king if you swing that way). Unless you feel like you really need those two things, you might as well just wait until Mozilla is done with the review process. 

People who aren't a fan of extensions:
This [link](http://cs.wmich.edu/~cdecastr/) leads to a page with a link that you can either drag to your bookmarks bar (chrome) or right click and then select 'bookmark this link' (firefox). I haven't tested it with other browsers, but I assume it should work too. It's the exact same functionality with the following exceptions:
* You don't have to install anything at all. It's just another bookmark link.
* Nothing happens automatically - pgn tags are only converted into games when you click on the bookmark.

It'll still be a lot faster than copy pasting the pgn to another site if you just want to view a game.

Other stuff:

* My (eventual - very, very, very eventual) todo list.
show game metadata.
try out stuff on the board.
automatically generate a chesspastebin link for those without the viewer.

* If you're posting multiple games, wrap them in one tag.

* Can you make it work in other sites?
 - I have it very tailored towards reddit since that's what the viewer is intended for. Making it work on other sites seems like a bad idea because: 
  1. If they're using pgn tags, then they probably have their own way of handling it already. I might end up messing with it.
	2. On reddit, there's a pretty easy way to search only posts and comments for pgn tags. On an unknown website, I'd have to look at the *entire* page for pgn tags since I have no idea where they might be. If there's a lot of elements on the page, this could end up redonkulously slow. If it's your own site, or a specific site in mind you're thinking of, it might just be easier to tailor a bookmarklet for you.

* Show the pgn text so I can save it?
Install RES, click view source on the post.

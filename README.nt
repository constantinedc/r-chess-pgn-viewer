Source code for r/chess pgn viewer. Chrome extension files in chrome folder,
firefox in ffox folder. 

todo: 
	Actually make a useful readme, also, do this in .md
	show more metadata, or maybe put it in something that can be toggled, defaults to hidden.
		this.showEvent=1;
		this.showRound=1;
		this.showSite=1;
		this.showDate=1;
	play out on board 
		export fen to lichess analysis board?

	expose the option object to pass to the viewer so people can costumize the board.
	show/copy/save pgn.
	multiple boards in one post
	[fen]position[fen] instead of [pgn][fen position][/pgn] seems more intuitive to people.
	a reddit bot to post fen image/link to external pgn viewer when seeing fen/pgn tags.
		This is the best thing I can think of to help people without the viewer, but I don't like that FEN would require
		people to have RES in order to view inline, and pgn would't be inline since it'd be to an external viewer.
	cleanup this code
		}, function(){
			$('.ct-back, .ct-forward, .ct-start, .ct-end, .ct-play, .ct-stop').css('display', 'inline');
			$($('#'+id+'-moves').children()[0]).remove();
		});
		--the css stuff is already handled by the .css file
		--make a change to declare this function outside the while loop and then just call it with the id. 
	actually, cleanup everything.
	automate the packaging process for chrome/firefox using grunt
